# CPSC122Projects
Projects from CPSC 122 section 1 - 2022 spring semester - include projects that have linked-lists, queues and stacks
Main project for this course was the calculator app which took inputs through the command line and adjusted them to post-fix and pre-fix format to 
allow the queues to help the program to run faster and use less space 
Explored the fundementals of functions, such as creating my own string function that concatinated chars from the command line into strings.
