# CPSC122Projects
Projects from CPSC 122 section 1 - 2022 spring semester - include projects that have linked-lists, queues and stacks
Main project for this course was the calculator app which took inputs through the command line and adjusted them to post-fix and pre-fix format to 
allow the queues to help the program to run faster and use less space
